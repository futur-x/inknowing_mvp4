## ðŸ“Š Business Logic Alignment

Based on .futurxlab documents:
- **Membership Tiers**: free, basic, premium, super
- **Payment Methods**: wechat, alipay (credit card for international)
- **State Transitions**: FreeUser â†’ Upgrading â†’ PaidMember
- **Quota System**:
  - Free: 20/day
  - Basic: 200/month
  - Premium: 500/month
  - Super: 1000/month
- **API Endpoints**:
  - POST /users/membership/upgrade
  - GET /users/membership
  - POST /payment/callback/wechat
  - POST /payment/callback/alipay
  - GET /payment/orders/{orderId}

## ðŸš¨ Discovered Issues/Risks
- Need to ensure mock payment system aligns with real provider integration
- Must handle currency conversion (CNY/USD)
- Need proper error recovery for failed payments

## âœ… Three Diagrams One Endpoint Consistency
- State diagram shows clear upgrade flow
- API spec defines payment endpoints
- Need to maintain quota consistency across upgrade

## ðŸš€ Next Steps
1. Start with membership plans page
2. Build payment infrastructure
3. Implement checkout flow step by step

## ðŸ’¡ Technical Decisions
- Use Zustand store for payment state management
- Implement optimistic UI updates for better UX
- Use React Hook Form for payment forms
- Mock Stripe-like payment flow for development
