## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow RESTful API design principles
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Write unit tests for all business logic
- Document all API endpoints with OpenAPI

### Security Requirements
- All endpoints must validate JWT tokens
- Implement rate limiting on public endpoints
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries for database
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest

### Performance Targets
- API response time < 200ms (excluding AI)
- Database queries < 100ms
- Support 10,000 concurrent users
- 99.9% uptime SLA

### Testing Requirements
- Unit test coverage > 80%
- Integration tests for all API endpoints
- Load testing for critical paths
- Security testing for authentication
- E2E tests for user journeys

## Task Tracking
Each task document includes:
- Detailed requirements
- API endpoints
- Database schemas
- Acceptance criteria
- Test cases
- Dependencies
- Implementation notes

Tasks should be tracked in project management tool with:
- Status (Not Started, In Progress, Review, Complete)
- Assignee
- Actual hours
- Blockers
- Code review status

## Notes
- All tasks are based on the API specification in `.futurxlab/api-specification.yaml`
- Business logic follows the conservation principle across all documents
- Each module is designed to be independently deployable
- Consider microservices architecture for scaling
