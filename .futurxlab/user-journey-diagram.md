## Business Logic Conservation Notes

1. **Complete Traceability**: Every user action maps to specific API endpoints
2. **State Consistency**: User state transitions are reflected in API responses
3. **Quota Management**: Built into dialogue initiation and message sending
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Features unlock based on membership tier
5. **Async Processing**: Upload flow uses polling pattern for status updates
