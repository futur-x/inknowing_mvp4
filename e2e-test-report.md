   - SQLAlchemy relationships have incorrect back_populates
   - Status: Needs immediate fix

2. **Enum Type Mismatches**
   - PostgreSQL enums are lowercase
   - Python enums are uppercase
   - Status: Requires alignment

3. **CORS Configuration**
   - OPTIONS requests returning 400 errors
   - Needs proper CORS middleware setup
   - Status: Configuration needed

### Frontend Issues
1. **API Client Configuration**
   - Proxy settings need verification
   - Authentication token handling needs testing
   - Status: Partially working

## Test Coverage Summary

| Module | Coverage | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Homepage | 100% | ‚úÖ Passing |
| Authentication | 0% | ‚è≥ Pending |
| Books | 0% | ‚è≥ Pending |
| Dialogues | 0% | ‚è≥ Pending |
| Uploads | 0% | ‚è≥ Pending |
| Payments | 0% | ‚è≥ Pending |
| Admin | 0% | ‚è≥ Pending |

## Performance Metrics

- **Total test duration**: 2.7s
- **Average test time**: 0.9s
- **Backend response time**: <350ms
- **Frontend load time**: ~1.1s

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Fix Backend ORM Issues**
   ```python
   # Update foreign key references
   user_id = Column(UUID, ForeignKey("auth.users.id"))
   ```

2. **Align Enum Definitions**
   ```python
   class MembershipType(enum.Enum):
       free = "free"  # lowercase to match PostgreSQL
       basic = "basic"
       premium = "premium"
       super = "super"
   ```

3. **Configure CORS Properly**
   ```python
   app.add_middleware(
       CORSMiddleware,
       allow_origins=["http://localhost:3555"],
       allow_methods=["*"],
       allow_headers=["*"]
   )
   ```

### Test Implementation Priority
1. Authentication flow tests (Critical)
2. Book browsing tests (High)
3. Dialogue system tests (High)
4. Upload functionality tests (Medium)
5. Payment flow tests (Medium)
6. Admin dashboard tests (Low)

## Test Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
cd frontend && npx playwright test

# Run specific test file
cd frontend && npx playwright test e2e/tests/homepage.spec.ts

# Run tests with UI mode
cd frontend && npx playwright test --ui

# Generate HTML report
cd frontend && npx playwright show-report
```

## Conclusion

The E2E testing framework is successfully configured and basic connectivity tests are passing. The system shows good frontend-backend integration with response times under 350ms. However, several backend issues need to be resolved before comprehensive testing can proceed.
